# IMU-GPS-DeadReckoning-Fusion

This project focuses on building a navigation stack using GPS and IMU sensors, with sensor fusion techniques to improve the accuracy of the obtained parameters. Various corrections and filtering methods are applied to deal with biases and errors in the sensor data. Despite some inaccuracies, the project demonstrates the potential of sensor fusion and dead reckoning for navigating in environments with limited GPS signal availability.
